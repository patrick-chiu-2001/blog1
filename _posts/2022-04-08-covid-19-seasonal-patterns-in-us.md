Radial charts can be used to visualize cyclical and seasonal changes, and trends over time. The images below show the results for Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. The data was collected by Johhs Hopkins University from January 2020 to March 2023 [1].

## Notes

1. For the Covid-19 cases, square-root scale is used to better see the smaller values.
2. More subtly, the angular scale is not exactly uniform as the graph goes around because the months do not have the same number of days. (Also, years do not have the same number of days due to leap years.)
